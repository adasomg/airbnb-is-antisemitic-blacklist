# Airbnb is antisemitic blacklist
Protest Airbnb's [Judea and Samaria jew ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/world/middleeast/airbnb-west-bank.html) by adding this blacklist of Airbnb-related hosts to your favorite ad-blocker.

# Installation
## Browser adblockers

With most major extensions simply [clicking this link](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adasomg/airbnb-is-antisemitic-blacklist/master/blacklist.txt&title=Airbnb%20is%20anti-semitic%20blacklist) should popup a prompt asking you to confirm adding the list.

In case this doesn't work you'll need to manually add this link:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adasomg/airbnb-is-antisemitic-blacklist/master/blacklist.txt

## Hosts file

If you want to apply the blacklist system-wide you'll need to append the contents of blacklist.txt to your `hosts` file. This may also be possible on your router if you have root access.

- Linux and most UNIX-based systems: `/etc/hosts`
- MacOS: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

# Share and help!
